Lung cancer is the second most common cancer diagnosed among men and women and the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. It has been frequently given as an example of cancer determined only by the environment, certain occupations, and dietary habits. Yet researchers have long had a hypothesis that people vary in their risk of becoming affected when exposed to these factors. Also, some evidence has shown that lung cancer in families may be due to the combined effects of inheritance of a major gene and cigarette smoking.||Individuals who have a confirmed diagnosis of lung cancer or a family history of lung cancer may be eligible to enroll their families in the study.||Family members will be asked to do one or more of the following:||Complete a questionnaire about personal medical history, lifestyle, and diet.|Have blood drawn from a vein in the arm.|If a family member has had a biopsy or is scheduled for one, give permission to obtain medical records and a portion of the stored tissue.|If any relatives have died of cancer, sign a release form to allow researchers to get copies of medical and pathology records, and tissue samples from surgery.||If the family members agree, they may be recontacted to answer questions about their health and those of their family, during an annual telephone conversation. Follow-up questionnaires may be sent to participants, to determine if any new cancers have developed in the family. In the event of a new cancer, the classification of the family may change from the low-risk to intermediate risk-level and from the intermediate-risk to high-risk level. Follow-up will continue, to get information about tumors and death. Also, a newsletter for lung cancer families will occasionally be distributed to participants. In the future, the Internet will also provide information for families.",,Determine whether there are gene-gene or gene-environment interactions contributing to lung cancer risk,Determine whether there are genetic variants contributing to lung cancer risk,"INCLUSION CRITERIA:||All individuals with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of lung cancer or a family of lung cancer are eligible to enroll their family in the study. Five major histologic types of lung cancer, i.e., adenocardinoma, squamous cell, small cell, large cell, and unspecified nonsmall cell carcinoma will be included. In addition to lung cancer patients, LSU will also contact patients newly diagnosed with bronchus or tracheal cancer in target hospital areas to request their enrollment in their study. In addition, several sites including LSU, Mayo Clinic and Karmanos Cancer Institute also collect DNA samples from unaffected, geographically and ethnically matched controls.||For the purposes of this study, an eligible family must meet the minimum criteria for familial lung cancer: at least 2 first-degree relatives in the family have had lung cancer. Priority will be given to more highly loaded pedigrees and to families in which the affected persons had onset of the disease at an early age (less than 50 years). Lung cancer cases may be living or deceased. Relatives with lung cancer are defined as first- o second-degree relatives or cousins of index cases will be eligible to participate in the study because their familial relationships might provide useful linkage information.||Adult participants must be physically able to tolerate removal of 25 to 40 ml of blood, or buccal brush sampling of their cheek. Children above 5 years old must be able to physically tolerate an amount of blood drawn that is equal to 4ml/kg of their weight. Adults must be willing to complete a self-administered environmental exposure questionnaire, and all participants must be able to consent to the study procedures (or have appropriate assent/parental consent). Biological specimens, including blood samples, archived tumor blocks and other medical records will be obtained from patients treated at the various hospitals and collection sites and from individuals with strong family history of lung cancer (either affected or unaffected) who have either been self-referred or physician referred to the study.||EXCLUSION CRITERIA:||Excluded from the study are families or individuals within the family who do not meet the minimum criteria described above. Individuals who do not sign the Consent Form will be excluded, and families for whom all necessary members do not sign the Consent Form may be excluded. MAYO also excludes patients who (1) do not speak English, (2) are non-US citizens or residents and (3) are diagnosed with an uncommon tumor type that is not among the above specified types (e.g.) mixed cell or unspecified non-small cell lung cancer, carcinoids, sarcomas and lymphomas of the lung and bronchus). This is done at MAYO because the family study is piggy-backed onto a case-control study. No fetuses, prisoners or institutionalized individuals will be enrolled. While this study does not target pregnant women, because contact with many of the families will be by mail we will not be able to exclude pregnant women. Additionally, the participant's own physician or health care clinic will draw blood samples from long-distance participants and therefore can determine if there is any risk to the woman or her fetus. UMHS also excludes children as research participants in their site.","Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the US, and represents a significant burden on health care resources. Accumulated evidence suggests that there are genetic susceptibility components in lung cancer, and that gene-environment interactions are important. While major breakthroughs have been made in understanding the genetic susceptibility basis of other cancers, studies to identify specific major loci affection lung cancer risk are notably lacking. The high case fatality rate (14 percent 5-year survival rate) and low resection rate (25 percent) makes the study of lung cancer families particularly challenging because it is difficult to collect adequate numbers of biospecimens for DNA analysis. Only a collaborative effort to identify, accrue, and genotype familial lung cancer (FLC) families will be successful in characterizing the genetic basis of familial lung cancer.||This project is part of a multi-center, multi-investigator, interdisciplinary team highly experienced in genetic epidemiology, gene mapping, lung biology, and cancer molecular genetics, known as the Genetic Epidemiology of Lung Cancer Consortium (GELCC) formed to identify a lung cancer susceptibility gene(s) and to estimate gene-environment interaction in the etiology of this neoplasm in order to elucidate a strategy for the prevention, control and clinical management of this disease through identification of genetically high-risk individuals.||Confirmation of a genetic predisposition for lung cancer may be possible by using linkage analysis to localize the putative susceptibility gene to a specific chromosomal region. The strength of linkage analysis is dependent upon the recruitment of multiple large kindreds for which tissue samples are available and the history of tumor incidence exists for two, preferably more, generations. Our strategy is to combine the most informative pedigrees but preferably eventually up to 500 pedigrees. This strategy yields a substantial increase in power and cost-effectiveness over the usual strategy of each site working independently and genotyping many marginally informative families. To date this strategy appears successful, in that results from our first 52 genotyped families resulted in significant evidence in favor of linkage to a region on chromosome 6q and suggestive evidence for several other regions. We believe that ongoing data collection and analysis of these preliminary results will also be fruitful. Recently, the National Cancer Institute funded this ongoing project in a competitive renewal (5 years) of our multi-center R01 that supports data collection and work at all sites besides NHGRI and NCI.||All data collection is under the direction of each P.I. at the data collection sites and funded by their respective grants and contracts. NHGRI investigators do not have any contact with study subjects and no NHGRI employees receive any funds from these grants. Because this disorder is complex and has a high likelihood of being caused by multiple loci, multiple parametric and non-parametric methods of analysis will be employed. Heterogeneity will be taken into account during these analyses, as will environmental covariates, such as the effect of smoking. Only statistical analyses are performed at the NHGRI site, but laboratory work ranging from genotyping, sequencing, array CGH, model organism experiments and other methods occurs at other sites as part of this collaboration.",,,,,Completed,Observational,"April 21, 2020"

Recent clinical trials provide evidence that screening with low dose CT scans will decrease lung cancer and all cause mortality among older heavy smokers. Clinical guidelines have been issued with the USPSTF recommending annual screening from age 55 to 80 for those with 30 pack years or more of smoking or who quit less than 15 years ago. Evidence clearly delineates both the benefits (mortality reduction) and harms (false positives, follow-up testing, risk of invasive testing, and risk of overdiagnosis) of lung cancer screening. Preliminary data from an HSR&D pilot grant finds that some Veterans are highly reluctant to enter the care pathway associated with lung cancer screening due to its potential harms. Additional preliminary data using Best Worst Scaling in older smokers demonstrate groups of patients who place greater importance on harms than benefit when considering lung cancer screening. Preference assessment methods can help Veterans to weigh benefits and harms, consider the clinical pathway they are entering, anticipate future health states, and communicate these values to their health care providers. Although basic educational tools to inform lung cancer decision-making have been developed, there is a lack of validated preference assessment tools that can be integrated into the clinical setting. Building upon preference assessment methods developed and validated in an HSR&D pilot grant (PI-Schapira) and using a trans-disciplinary approach, this team is positioned to advance the science and practice of decision support for lung cancer screening in the Veteran population. The objectives of this study are to 1) elicit patient and provider stakeholder input to inform the development of a lung cancer screening decision tool, 2) develop a web based Lung Cancer Screening Decision Tool (LCSDecTool) that incorporates patient and provider input, and 3) evaluate the impact of the LCSDecTool compared to usual care on the decision process, clinical outcomes, and quality of life. The study will be conducted in 3 phases. In phase 1, mixed methods will be used to assess usability of preference assessment methods and perceived usefulness of a web based lung cancer screening decision support tool among patient and provider stakeholders. In phase 2, an interactive web based decision support program will be developed that incorporates preference assessment methods. In phase 3, a pilot RCT will be conduced to evaluate the efficacy of the web based decision support program. Outcomes evaluated will include decision quality as indicated by knowledge, decisional conflict, and decision regret; screening behavior, clinical outcomes as indicated by anxiety, and quality of life. The study will be conducted across two VA sites; West Haven-VA in Connecticut and Corporal Michael J. Crescenz VA in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Results of this study will provide tools that can be used to integrate lung cancer screening into clinical practice at VA Medical Centers in a patient centered approach. Lung cancer screening is fundamentally different from existing screening paradigms in several respects; eligibility is defined by a behavior (smoking), a high rate of false positive findings is expected, and the target population is older with higher comorbidity than the target population for cervical, breast, or colorectal screening. Given these unique aspects of lung cancer screening, there is a critical need to develop and test tools for preference assessment and informed decision making that are applicable for the VA setting. The current proposal provides a mechanism to accomplish these goals. The Principal Investigator is working closely with the US Department of Veterans Affairs National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention to integrate the tools and paradigm developed to primary care in the VA Medical Care System. The work builds directly upon a recently completed HSR&D pilot support in the area of lung cancer and shared decision making.",Not Applicable,Experimental|Active Comparator,Behavioral: Lung Cancer Screening Decision Tool|Behavioral: Control Intervention,This will be a lung cancer screening decision support tool that is web based and provides patients with information about the potential benefits and harms associated with lung cancer screening and helps them to consider their personal values when making a decision about whether to initiate or continue with lung cancer screening.|This will be a health message regarding prevention and healthy behavior that is not related to lung cancer screening but delivered in a similar modality and taking approximately the same amount of time as the LCSDecTool.,Recruiting,Interventional,"February 21, 2021"

Surgical resection could achieve better prognosis in patients with early lung cancer (stages IA and IB).For patients with advanced lung cancer (stages II, III, and IV), individualized treatment with molecular classification researches and the application of targeted drugs based on the pathological classification, molecular genetic characteristics, and body conditions of patients has been confirmed to effectively prolong the lifetime. However, the lack of effective and convenient detection approaches for capturing oncology information of patients, promoting early diagnosis and effective intervention of lung cancer, and ultimately improving the prognosis of lung cancer are limitations in achieving successful clinical treatment of lung cancer.||At present, methods used in clinical screening of lung cancer,including detection of serological markers, imaging technology, and biopsy ,have some limitations:in the absence of imaging evidence, the serological assessment could not be used as the evidence for diagnosis and treatment strategy alteration for lung cancer. The application of low-dose computed tomography scan for lung cancer screening shows a high false-positive rate, which is liable to require excessive medical treatment. Biopsy does greater harm to patients with lung cancer; sampling is difficult, and effective information may be missed because of tumor heterogeneity. With the development of molecular pathology in cancer research in recent years, liquid biopsy has become an important developmental direction for clinical tumor detection because of its noninvasiveness, convenient sampling, and potential for overcoming tumor heterogeneity.Liquid biopsies include the detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), tumor exosome (exosome), circulating tumor RNA (ctRNA), and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in peripheral blood.||ctDNA is a part of circulating free DNA (cfDNA), which is released by tumor cell necrosis, apoptosis, micrometastasis, or the cleavage of CTCs and proliferated tumor cells.ctDNA includes genetic information of tumor cells, such as mutation, recombination, and deletion (15). ctDNA was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2014 and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines for NSCLC in 2017 as a supplement sample to assess genetic variation when tumor tissue samples were difficult to obtain. Clinical studies have shown that ctDNA can effectively reflect tumor load, malignant degree, metastasis ability, and real-time information of genetic mutation, which has a certain correlation with the genetic information of tumor tissues. Moreover, the content of cfDNA in patients with cancer was significantly higher than that in healthy people. Also, ctDNA has been used for detecting tumor load, monitoring tumor recurrence, and assessing minimal residual disease in a number of cancer types. Some studies have suggested that ctDNA can be used to estimate tumor recurrence, even before imaging. Therefore, ctDNA detection has an important value in the clinical application of lung cancer diagnosis, drug efficacy, surgical effect evaluation, recurrence monitoring, prognosis judgment, medication guidance, and molecular classification differentiation.||This study intends to include 1000-2000 patients with stages I-IV lung cancer. The capture sequencing of lung cancer-related genes in peripheral blood ctDNA and tumor tissue DNA will be performed during the diagnosis and treatment process using the liquid-phase hybridization approach. Thus, the study will establish a large sample size database of the genetic variants in patients with lung cancer during the diagnosis and treatment process, and promoted the development of an individualized diagnostic model of the lung cancer population. The patients with lung cancer undergoing surgery will be followed up, and the plasma concentration of cfDNA and genetic mutation of ctDNA will be detected to evaluate the postoperative residual cancer, monitor tumor recurrence, and timely guide the clinical treatment and intervention. The molecular classification differentiation analysis and screening of tumor recurrence-related genetic mutations will be performed after the surgery and during the course of disease progression to provide the referential clinical research model and ideas for the application of ctDNA detection-based liquid biopsy technique in tumor therapy.",,,,,"Active, not recruiting",Observational,"October 19, 2020"

In 80% of cases lung cancer, in early phase, is treatable only with surgery without chemotherapy or adjuvant radiotherapy and the survival perspective at five years exceeds 70%. Several scientific guidelines recommends chest CT (computed tomography) in lung cancer screening.

In the past years several programs have been developed to screen for lung cancer using low-dose chest computed radiography (CT). However, only recently different studies demonstrated a clear reduction in mortality. In particular, NLST low dose CT screening trial demonstrated a 6.7% reduction in the death rate compared to chest X-ray with a positive screening test rate for lung cancer detection of 24.2%, compared to 6.9% for conventional X-ray. Digital tomosynthesis (DTS) is a limited angle tomography that allows reconstruction of multiple image planes from a set of projection data acquired over a relatively small angle of X-ray tube movement. Although it does not have the spatial depth resolution of computed tomography, it provides high-resolution images in the sagittal planes at a lower dose and cost than CT. Several studies have shown that DTS offers advantages over conventional chest X-ray and comparable of those of CT. The Studio OSservazionale (SOS) was a clinical trial conducted within Santa Croce e Carle Hospital analysing smokers and former smokers aged 45-80 with no cancer diagnosis.

Lymph nodes are small glands found throughout the body that remove bacteria and foreign particles (part of the immune system). A biopsy (tissue sample) can then be sent can be sent to the laboratory for testing. Biopsy results can determine if the cancer has spread (metastases) and to determine the best treatment for a patient with lung cancer.||The purpose of this study is to develop a better way to detect lung cancer earlier before it spreads. This study compares the traditional mediastinoscopy/thoracoscopy surgery with the newer combined Endobronchial Ultrasound (EBUS) and Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) -guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) to see if either is better for this purpose. Traditional medical practice is to surgically open the chest and biopsy suspicious lymph nodes (called a mediastinoscopy/thoracoscopy). Some medical centers have already started combining the use of EUS plus EBUS as a standard practice for performing needle biopsy of lymph nodes in the chest to stage and treat lung cancer.||Volunteers for this study have been diagnosed with known or suspected lung cancer, and will receive one of two choices to determine if their cancer has spread:||Traditional Surgical Mediastinoscopy/Thoracoscopy Mediastinoscopy is a surgical procedure that allows physicians to view areas of the chest(including the heart, vessels, lymph nodes, trachea, esophagus, and thymus). An endotracheal (within the trachea) tube is inserted followed by a small incision (cut) in the chest. A mediastinoscope is inserted through the incision to see the organs inside the mediastinum and to collect tissue samples. Mediastinoscopy can be used to detect or stage cancer.||Thoracoscopy is a surgical procedure that involves insertion of a thorascope through a very small incision in the chest wall. A thorascope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and lens which usually has a tool for removing tissue. This makes it possible to examine the lungs or other structures in the chest cavity, without making a large incision.||EBUS combined with EUS-guided FNA EUS involves the use of a special endoscope fitted with an ultrasound processor at its tip. During EUS, images of surrounding lymph nodes can be obtained and a small needle can be guided through the esophagus into suspicious nodes to biopsy lymph nodes in the chest. Other research studies have shown that using EUS to guide needle biopsy of lymph nodes in the chest is equally if not more accurate than surgical biopsy. However, use of EUS for needle biopsy can limit what is seen by the physician and also limit the sampling of lymph nodes in front of the trachea. EBUS involves the use of a small ultrasound scope that is passed through the opening of the trachea and into the airways.

Therefore the yield of screening for lung cancer is not a question anymore and the urgent unmet need is to define the group that is under a high risk for lung cancer.||Our lab is focusing on revealing non-invasive biomarkers as for early detection of lung cancer.

Unfortunately, most lung cancers are detected and diagnosed at a very advanced stage and this complicates treatment options. Therefore, there is dire, unmet need to develop an effective, highly sensitive, highly specific and non-invasive screening method. The solution to this problem may be found in volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which are organic molecules identified in exhaled breath. These VOCs differ between those individuals who suffer from lung cancer and healthy individuals. Seeing as increased glycolysis is one of the characteristic patterns of malignancies, the purpose of this study is to determine the contribution of induced glycolysis to these exhaled VOCs. Therefore, this study will compare exhaled breath samples in individuals who suffer from lung cancer before and after a glucose challenge test. This study aims to better understand the mechanisms involved in order to identify the distinguishing VOCs. This may aid in developing the so necessary diagnostic means for lung cancer screening.||Introduction:||Lung cancer is the moth lethal cancer in both men and women. [1] There are two main classes of lung cancer: the first, Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) which is often referred to as Oat Cell Cancer, and the second being Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), which constitutes the majority of cases of lung cancer. [2] Unfortunately, most lung cancer detection and diagnosis is performed when the cancer is in an advanced, metastatic stage in which surgery is not a viable treatment option. [3] Thus, detection and diagnosis its early stages may significantly improve the five year survival rate as well as provide the possibility of a cure.||An effective, non-invasive lung cancer screening method for distinguishing biological markers found in high-risk groups has yet to be developed. Lately, researchers have begun considering Volatile Organic Compounds' (VOCs) templates as a possible means for early detection. These VOCs can be retrieved and isolated from exhaled breath samples. The VOCs reflect the unique metabolic and biochemical activity in malignant cells. This association has been proven in several researchers as well as in our own group [4] who has shown that not only can VOCs distinguish between healthy and affected individuals, but they can even discern between SCLC and NSCLC. [5, 6] The current research will focus on the detection, identification and the characterization of these unique biological markers found in the exhaled breath of those who suffer from lung cancer. Amongst those VOCs which are detected, this research will specifically focus on those VOCs which hold the potential to be incorporated into an effective, non-invasive screening method for lung cancer.||Carcinogenesis is a process that is bound to somatic evolution. One of the most popular evolutionary advantages found in malignant, metastatic cells is the increased uptake of glucose through the process of glycolysis. This glycolysis process is unique to malignant cell because it is most pronounced in anaerobic conditions, whereas healthy cells most often perform glycolysis in aerobic conditions. Anaerobic glycolysis- the process of the conversion of glucose to lactic acid in the presence of oxygen- is also known as the ""Warburg Effect"" after Otto Warburg who discovered this characteristic. [7]||Thus, some of the distinguishing processes found in malignant cells are the exceeded rate of substance exchange and increased glucose degradation (Warburg Effect). These processes release organic compounds, some of which are released into exhaled breath. Therefore, this research will examine the relationship between a glucose challenge test and its effect on the pattern on VOCs in exhaled breath.||Research Goals:||The template for organic particles in exhaled breath discriminates between those individuals who suffer from active lung cancer from those individuals who are considered healthy. The purpose of this study is to examine the contribution of the process of glycolysis to this unique template. Being that the process of glycolysis is accelerated in malignant cells, we hypothesize that the glucose challenge test will express VOC in those individuals who suffer from the disease. These findings can contribute to the development of diagnostic tools for lung cancer.||Hypothesis:||We hypothesize that the Warburg Effect is an essential component in the creation of VOCs that are unique to lung cancer, and therefore, that the glucose challenge test will increase the production of these VOCs. These markers hold the potential to create a more effective, non-invasive screening method with improved sensitivity and specificity.||Methods:||4.1 Research Design: This research is an observational case-control study assesses the comparison between the VOCs samples obtained from exhaled breath samples and blood tests taken before and after a glucose challenge test. The glucose challenge test involves drinking a solution which contains 75 grams of glucose and a waiting period of 90 minutes between the collection of exhaled breath and blood samples. There is a need to fast for six hours before this test. In addition, a clinical assessment will be performed based on the medical anamnesis and on existing, current medical information.||4.2 Study Population: The goal of this research is to determine if the process of glycolysis contributes to the unique VOC pattern in the exhaled breath of those who are affected with lung cancer. The participants will be chosen from individuals that are currently being treated in pulmonology clinics for various reasons. The control group will include participants that have been identified as high-risk individuals for lung cancer, whereas the study group will include participants who suffer from active lung cancer but have not yet begun any form of medical treatment.||The recruitment process will be performed in two consecutive stages. In the first stage, twenty patients from the study group will be compared to the twenty participants from the control group. At this point, a preliminary assessment of the data will be performed to find differences in the VOCs between these two groups. Only in the event that these differences are found will the research go on to the second stage, in which 30 more participants will be recruited and tested for the study group.||The control group as previously mentioned will include 20 participants that do not have lung cancer, but are similar to the research group in terms of age, gender, medical history, and history of smoking. This classification will be performed based off the self-report surveys completed by the participants.||Exclusion criterions for the study population are as follows:||Patients that are uninterested to participant and/or unable to sign a consent form|Lung Cancer patients who have begun treatment prior to this research|Patients who are unable to complete this research and/or the follow up visits|Individuals that suffer from diabetes||4.3 Research Variables:||The main variables which will be used to test our hypothesis are as follows:||Epidemiological variables of the participants|Quantitative data defining the malignant cells ( TMN, the size of the tumor, number of metastases and their location)|The glucose levels( via a dipstick) before and after the glucose challenge test (requires a fast of 6 hours prior to the test)|The VOCs pattern obtained from the exhaled breath samples and the characterization of these molecules via the GCMS method.||4.4 Research Methods:||Medical Anamnesis:||A collection of the details of the patient's medical history will be obtained. Information such as gender, age, medical history, consumption of tobacco and family history will be noted. In addition, information which quantifies and qualifies the malignant cells (if present) will be collected and recorded. This includes details such as the type of tumor as well as its place, volume, histological characteristics and imaging results. Some of the medical information will be obtained from pre-existing updated medical records.||Exhaled Breath Test:||Each participant will undergo an exhaled breath test before and after the glucose challenge test with a lay period of 90 minutes in between the tests.||The detailed explanation regarding the process of collection of the exhaled breath samples:||The patient will exhale 3 breaths (with 750 ml in each exhaled breath) into appropriate Mylar bags in a sterile area with technology that ensures that the exhaled breath is isolated and unaffected from the external environment. The contents of the Mylar bags will be stored in TENAX samples which preserves the samples for a period of six months. The samples will undergo additional analysis at the Israel Institute of Technology (Technion) under the auspices of Professor Haim Hussam. Each sample will be analyzed for the purposes of identifying VOCs via the GC-MS method. The sample will undergo additional processing such as SPME (pre-concentration into solid-phase micro extraction). The SPME will be transferred to the GC-MS. The GC-MS method allows for the identification of the compounds in a short period of time via the use of chromatographic and spectroscopic instruments. The spectroscopic instrument will undergo additional analysis via the AOS instrument. The AOS includes detectors which are conjugated to nano-particles of gold. Each detector identifies a wide variety of VOCs in accordance to their location and concentration which cause varying levels of resistance. This response is recorded and will undergo statistical analysis via PCA to focus on the specific VOC patterns found in the sample.||The detailed explanation of the process of the glucose challenge test is as follows:||The participant is requested to drink a sugary solution (273 ml) constituted from 75 grams of glucose and water. The test requires that the participant fast for a period of 6 hours before the test. After drinking the solution, the participant must wait a lay period of 90 minutes before the retest of his or her exhaled breath. In addition, the level of glucose will be tested by a dipstick before drinking the solution, and after the 90 minute lay period.||4.5 Statistical Analysis: The sample size is 70 persons ( 40 persons in the first stage, and an additional 30 participants in the second stage as explained above).||The expectation is that there will be a significant difference between the VOC template before and after the glucose challenge test. The estimated difference of effect is around 30%, with the assumption that the sampling error stands at around 10% and with a confidence interval of 95%. The number of necessary participants needed in order to achieve results with statistical significance and size effect ranges from approximately 20-25 persons.||The information from the AOS which recorded the changes in resistance will be analyzed via PCA to focus on the specific VOC pattern changes obtained in each sample.||The remaining variables which were measured quantitatively will be presented in averages with their corresponding standard deviations. Those variables that were obtained quantitatively will be presented as percentages.||Statistical analysis for significance will be performed by the following statistical tests: Student's T Test, Chi-Square, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and the Kruskal-Wallis test. All statistical tests will be performed on the SPSS computer program.",,,,,Unknown status,Observational,"February 21, 2014"

Most of the patients with early lung cancer are asymptomatic, while 75% of patients with cancer-related symptom at diagnosis have local or distant metastasis. Compared to a 5-yr SR of 70-90% in stage I/II lung cancer, the 5-yr SR in late stage IIIb/IV is less than 15%. Despite the progress in pharmaceutical treatment for late stage disease, early detection is still the only way to improve the outcome and even cure of this potentially lethal disease. Low dose computed tomography (LDCT) in recognized as the best tool available for early diagnosis of lung cancer. However, the radiation exposure, high cost and high false-positive rate are the major concerns to adapt this detection tool to general population. Recent studies from Europe and US have shown that LDCT screening in high-risk cigarette smoking population can effectively reduce lung cancer mortality. However, the major type of lung cancer in Taiwan is adenocarcinoma, which commonly occurs in non-smoker. Therefore, the risk prediction model generated from studies of western countries may not be suitable for directly adapted to our country. LDCT screening for lung cancer detection in non-smoker remains a controversial issue worldwide, including Taiwan. Facing the unmet need, it is urgent to establish the risk assessment model to predict lung cancer risks in non-smokers and to evaluate the efficacy of LDCT screening in non-smoker high-risk population.

Until today no effective method permits the early detection of lung cancer. Consequently, lung cancer is often diagnosed owing to symptoms of advanced disease. To address this problem, detection methods with an improved sensitivity and specificity are urgently needed.||Over the past decade, accumulating evidence shows that the metabolism of cancer cells differs from that of normal cells. More specifically, the entire metabolism of cancer cells is reorganized or reprogrammed to increase anabolic reactions that induce cell growth and survival. Metabolic reprogramming during the development of cancer is driven by aberrant signaling pathways due to the activation of oncogenes and the loss of tumor suppressor genes. Furthermore, the microenvironment of the tumor plays a role in metabolic reprogramming. The altered cancer metabolism is characterized by an increased glycolysis, the production of lactate and the biosynthesis of macromolecules, such as proteins, lipids and nucleotides. Cancer cells have a high glycolytic rate and eliminate most of the glucose-derived carbon as lactate rather than oxidizing it completely via oxidative phosphorylation, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. The breakdown of glucose and other nutrients leads to a high energy production and provides the Krebs cycle with intermediates, which consequently are allocated to metabolic pathways that support biosynthesis. Metabolites are the end products of cellular metabolism and are therefore closely related to the observed phenotype. Disturbances in biochemical pathways which occur during the development of cancer consequently provoke changes in the metabolic phenotype. As a result, low-molecular weight metabolites are very attractive biomarkers for different cancer types. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy enables the identification and quantitative analysis of complex mixtures of metabolites, as in plasma and serum, without an extended sample preparation.||The present study aims to determine the metabolic phenotype of lung cancer by means of proton (1H)-NMR spectroscopy. Once the phenotype determined (training cohort), this has to be validated by an independent cohort.",26949046,Overall survival|Progression-free survival|Histology|Stage,Metabolic phenotype of lung cancer,Inclusion Criteria:||Diagnosis of a new lesion in the lung||Exclusion Criteria:||a prior diagnosis of cancer in the past|Not fasted for at least 6 hours|Plasma glucose concentration ≥ 200 mg/dl|Intake of medication at the day of investigation|History/treatment of cancer in the previous 5 years,"Subjects Subjects with lung cancer detected by a computed tomography (CT)-scan and referred to a positron emission tomography (PET)/CT-scan are included.

Exclusion criteria are as follows: (1) not fasted for at least 6 hours, (2) poorly controlled diabetes (fasting plasma glucose concentration ≥ 200 mg/dl) in cancer patients, (3) medication intake at the day of blood sampling and (4) treatment or history of cancer in the preceding 5 years.||The training cohort consists of 80 subject with lung cancer and 80 controls. The validation cohort consist of 250 subject with lung cancer and 250 controls.||Blood sampling and processing Fasting venous blood samples (BD Vacutainer® LH 17 I.U. 10 ml tube) are collected and stored at 4°C within 5 to 10 minutes. Around 8 hours after blood collection, blood samples are transported on crushed ice to the central laboratory and centrifuged at room temperature (swinging bucket centrifuge, 1600 g, 15 minutes). Subsequently, 4 plasma aliquots of 500 µl are transferred into sterile cryovials and stored at -80°C until examination within 6 months. When subjects give permission to store their biological material, 3 aliquots are stored at the University Biobank Limburg (UBiLim) for biomedical research purposes.||Prior to NMR analysis, plasma aliquots are thawed and homogenized using a vortex mixer. After centrifugation at 13000 g for 4 minutes at 4°C (fixed rotor Eppendorf centrifuge 5415 R, Hamburg, Germany), plasma aliquots are diluted in deuterium oxide (D2O, 99.9%, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc, Andover, USA) containing 180 µg/µl trimethylsilyl-2,2,3,3-tetradeuteropropionic acid (TSP, 98%, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc, Andover, USA) as a chemical shift reference. Finally, the prepared plasma samples are transferred into a 5 mm NMR tube and analyzed.||1H-NMR analyses and assignment of present resonances The 1H-NMR spectra are recorded on a 400 Megahertz (MHz) NMR spectrometer (Varian/Agilent, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Instruments, Palo Alto, California, USA) with a magnetic field strength of 9.4 Tesla at 294 K. Slightly T2- weighted spectra are acquired using a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) pulse sequence to attenuate signals of macromolecules, such as proteins and polysaccharides. Additionally, water suppression is performed in order to allow optimal detection and quantification of low-molecular weight metabolites. The 1H-NMR spectra are phased manually, baseline corrected and referenced to the TSP resonance at 0.015 parts per million (ppm). The assignment of the present 1H-NMR resonances occurs by means of spiking experiments. A reference plasma sample is alternately spiked with 34 known metabolites with a concentration of 1 mg compound per 100 µl plasma. The obtained chemical shifts are double checked with Chenomx NMR suite software (Version 7.5, Chenomx Inc., Edmonton, Alberta, Canada). Finally, 1H-NMR spectra are divided in 112 spectral regions, which are integrated and normalized relative to the total integrated area of all spectral regions, irrespective of the remaining water, TSP, fructose and glucose resonances. The end result corresponds to 110 normalized integration regions (all integration regions except those of water and TSP).||Statistical analysis At first, the integration values of all 110 spectral regions are analyzed by means of a student t-test with correction for multiple testing by Benjamini-Hochberg to identify those which differ significantly between lung cancer patients and controls (IBM SPSS Version 20.0, Chicago, Illinois, USA). Secondly, multivariate statistical analyses are performed using SIMCA-P+ (Version 12.0, Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) to investigate whether the metabolic composition of blood plasma allows to discriminate between lung cancer patients and controls. An unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to identify intrinsic clusters and outliers within the dataset. After the removal of outliers (detected by a Hotelling's T2 range plot), an orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), an extension of partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) with an integrated orthogonal signal correction filter, is performed to remove variability not relevant to class separation. The predicted classification is expressed as specificity (the percentage of controls that are actually classified as controls) and sensitivity (the percentage of lung cancer patients that are actually classified as lung cancer patients). The outcome of using the integration values of the significantly different spectral regions, obtained by the student t-test with correction for multiple testing by Benjamini-Hochberg, is compared to the outcome in which the integration values of all 110 spectral regions were used.",,,Other: Venous blood sample|Other: Venous blood sample,Collection of a venous blood sample to investigate metabolic changes in blood,Completed,Observational,"August 21, 2018"

Screening for early detection of cancer at an early stage reduces cancer deaths and therefore improves prognosis. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), for instance, showed that CT screening increases the early detection rate, and reduces mortality. However, drawbacks include over-diagnosis, false-positive results, psychological distress and cost. Therefore, lung cancer screening is not recommended or available within the NHS.||Diagnosis of lung cancer is currently based on a combination of scans and tissue biopsy. The invasive nature of current diagnostic procedures limits their application. To improve the efficacy and cost effectiveness of screening in early detection of lung cancer, additional, complementary and non-invasive methods, such as circulating biomarkers, should be evaluated. Our novel exosomal assay (taken from a blood sample) when combined with CT, may improve the current accuracy of lung cancer detection, especially that of a worse clinical prognosis. Improvement in the accuracy of detection and/or prediction of future disease by performing the combined imaging exosome test will cause a paradigm shift. Moving towards the identification of blood tests can help increase confidence about follow-up decisions and shorten the interval before biopsy.||This prospective cohort study will recruit patients referred to secondary care for the investigation of clinical symptoms or signs suspicious of lung cancer.||The study will run between 2020 and 2024 (two-year active recruitment and two-year follow up).||Participants will have a single assay of blood taken on one occasion in the lung clinic by trained staff.||Participants will have normal standard of care chest CT scans and this data will be used.||All participants will be actively followed for 3 months and then those with nodules, revealed by CT Scan, at 3 monthly intervals.

For those with stage 1 disease, the chance of cure is up to 70%. Therefore, diagnostics which may aid identification of those with early stage lung cancer will play an important role in future screening programs. Because all cancer cells are characterized by a change in their metabolism related to their uncontrolled growth, detection of the resulting metabolites may be a novel diagnostic tool for early stage lung cancer. Subsets of these metabolites are volatile and are exhaled as so-called volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Analysis of exhaled VOCs suggests they differ between patients with advanced lung cancer and healthy controls. The Lung Cancer Indicator Detection (LuCID) study aims to validate the use of a high-throughput breath analysis technique in a population of patients whom are clinically suspected of having lung cancer.||Methods LuCID is an international, multi-center case-control study. Patients referred by their GP or treating specialist for a diagnostic work-up for lung cancer will be invited to participate in the study. A maximum of two thousand five hundred patients whom consent to partake in this study will be asked to provide a breath sample prior to any diagnostic procedures. This is a non-invasive procedure that will require the patient to breath normally into a facemask to collect 2.5L of breath amounting to approximately 10 minutes of breathing. The resulting samples will be analyzed for VOCs by Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry and Gas Chromotography coupled to Field Assymetrical Ion Mobility Spectrometry. The resulting VOC profiles will be used to generate a diagnostic algorithm in order to try to differentiate between patients with and without lung cancer in the intention to diagnose population. This study will not interfere in any with the standard care offered at the clinical sites.||Outcomes The results of this study will provide detailed insights into the accuracy of the test for the detection of lung cancer in the intention to diagnose population. This will form the foundation for a subsequent study in a population at risk for the development of lung cancer. If sufficiently accurate for early stage disease, analysis of breath VOCs could help implement large-scale screening for lung cancer, significantly decreasing the morbidity and mortality of the disease.",Not Applicable,Experimental,Device: ReCIVA breath sampler,Device developed for standardised collection of breath samples http://www.owlstonenanotech.com/medical/products/reciva,"Active, not recruiting",Interventional,"February 24, 2021"

But, there is always a subgroup of patients who do not benefit from treatment and which has a very low survival. The risk of death for patients is very variable depending on the initial cancer site, tumor aggressiveness and chemosensitivity of tumours.||It's therefore important to have relevant prognostic tools to predict such an excess of relative toxicity or drug resistance. Simple prognostic factors for survival as the performance status (PS) have already been highlighted in several studies. Thus, the possibility to identify a group of patients with a higher risk of mortality could be of major interest for clinicians. In fact such stratification will allow:||To limit this risk by adjusting the therapy and/or associated treatments (antibiotic prophylaxis, dose reduction ...),|To develop protocols for testing innovative strategies specific to this high risk population.||The objectives of these innovative protocols would be designed to correct lymphodivpenia.||The main objective is to show that T divpenia (low TCR combinatorial diversity <30%) is a risk factor for early death after chemotherapy (early death: any death occurring within 3 months (lung cancer) or within 6 months (breast cancer) after the start of chemotherapy).||The secondary objectives are:||To establish that the divpenia factor is independent of clinical and biological prognostic factors (PS, LDH, haemoglobin, lymphopenia or ANC) to predict a early death,|To establish that the prognostic score NDL which will combine in a two-dimensional graph the CD4 count or total lymphocytes count and TCR repertoire diversity will allow a better stratification of lympho-divpenic patients who will benefit from more appropriate treatments,|To characterize other circulating markers this could improve the identification of the early death risk (phenotypic markers, cytokines ...) in combination with the previous settings.||Prognostic models have been established in many tumor types at the initial stage or at time of the relapse (breast and lung cancers ...). It seems necessary to highlight other clinical and biological prognostic factors that would estimate a lower survival at 6 months, whatever the nature or the original site of the tumour.||The strong prognostic value of lymphopenia in the early death after chemotherapy or hematologic toxicity of chemotherapy has recently been established in several tumor models. 25% of patients with metastatic solid cancers have a systemic immune dysfunction.||Further analysis incorporating prior any treatment (D0) a systematic phenotypic analysis of lymphocyte subpopulations in the patients' blood showed that a significant reduction in the absolute number of peripheral CD4+ T cells (<450/μl) was an independent factor risk of early death and febrile neutropenia in patients with solid cancers of different origin (lymphoma, myeloma, sarcoma, breast cancer) treated with chemotherapy.||However, early death remains rare events and a more recent study has established that a lymphopenia (<1000 lymphocytes/µl) was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in patients with solid tumours.||Recent studies have shown the importance of combinatorial diversity of T and B lymphocytes repertoire (TCR/BCR) in the efficiency of the immune response against infection.||A preliminary analysis of TCR repertoire diversity, in a retrospective cohort of patients with metastatic breast cancer, demonstrated the independent predictive value of divpenia for overall survival in these patients. This research has demonstrated that patients with cancer had a very large disparity in immune TCR diversity and that it was not always correlated with lymphocyte count.||These preliminary data show that the discriminating power of TCR diversity is greater than the measurement of cell count.

The overall prognosis of NSCLC is poor with low 5-year survival rates. Recent advances suggest that malignancy NSCLC cancers are the cancer stem cell (CSC) diseases. The stemness potentials of CSC with epithelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation ensure their invasion and disseminate to metastsis organs. The self-renewal property of CSC mediates intrinsic drug resistance to cytotoxicity therapy and promoted aggressive relapse tumour. Metabolic reprogramming on bioenergetics of malignant cancer cells has been proposed as the key mediator in the stemness CSC development. Malignancy cells uptake glucose for fermented glycolysis to produce lactate which release resulted in acidified microenvironment to trigger the mTOR and sonic hedgehog metabolic stress signaling in supporting CSC stemness potentials. The metabostemness of cancer cells is the new-dimensional hallmark of malignancy tumour, which may serve as the diagnostic markers for the early detection of malignancy cancers. Folate-mediated one carbon metabolism coordinates glucose into amino acid metabolism to tailor the fuel metabolites in supporting macromolecule synthesis and to sustain the bioenergetics requirement. Acting as the metabolic stressor, low folate intake is associated with increased risks of lung cancers. Folate and one-carbon nutrient status of NSCLC patients in Taiwan, however, has not been assessed.

With around 39500 new cases in 2012 in France, lung cancer ranks fourth regarding cancer incidence for both women and men. In 2012 it caused the highest number of annual deaths linked to cancer (around 30 000 deaths) according to the Institut National Du Cancer (INCA). It is a real public health issue, its incidence has been increasing above all in women and its prognosis is grim. The 1-year survival rate is 43% and 5-year survival rate 14% whatever the stage of the disease.||The Picardy region presents an excess mortality of 18% compared to the national average for the lung cancer and Somme has one of the highest incidence rate in France for this cancer.||Research hypothesis:||If the investigators know that tobacco smoke is the main risk factor, the other feature of this cancer is characterized by a diagnosis at an advanced stage when only limited, palliative treatments which are heavy, and costly can be provided Proposing the screening test with low dose helical computed tomography (LD-CT) has the aim to spot this cancer at an early stage when a curative surgical treatment is still possible in order to improve the survival chances.||Indeed screening by low dose CT showed a decrease of the death rate by 20 % of lung cancer and by 6 % for all the causes in the National Lung Screening Trial published in 2011.||If this screening test has for goal to diagnose lung cancers at an early stage, it also highlights in a quarter of the cases benign abnormalities requiring mainly further non invasive explorations. This low specificity is one of the reasons why in France the Haute Autorite Sante (HAS) has concluded that the current conditions were not met to authorize this screening in general population and insist on carrying the research for this screening.||Decreasing the number of false positives by selecting the targeted population and optimizing the decision algorithms would enable to improve the specificity of low dose CT as screening test of lung cancer.||Description of the intervention:||The rationale of this project is to use already existing networks among health care providers and between the health care providers and the departmental cancer screening agency (ADEMA 80) which is already in charge with the breast and colon cancer screening.||The targeted population of this screening concerns men and women from 55 to 74 year old who are smoking with a tobacco exposure of more than 30 pack-years or those who stopped for less than 15 years without obvious symptoms and who accept the screening tests with information on the results and the consequences which can arise ( non invasive exploration , CT after 3 months, Positon Emission Tomography scan or invasive exploration : CT guided biopsy, bronchoscopy, surgical exploration ) and who signed a consent form.||People with a history of cancer of less than 5 years, worsening of their health state, heart or respiratory morbidities which prevent a chest surgery are excluded of this study.||The population which is likely to undergo this test (male and female smokers from 55 to 74 years old) is estimated to 48 000 inhabitants for the department of the Somme which has a total population of 584 000 inhabitants.||The screening test is offered by primary care doctors and pneumologists of the Somme whom an invitation was sent by mail and who have accepted the way and means of the study.||The CT is prescribed on a prescription pad with 3 carbonless documents delivered by ADEMA 80 to the participating doctors: a part for the patient in order to take an appointment for his exam, one part which is sent back to ADEMA 80 with a prepaid envelope to keep a track and one part for the prescribing doctor. The LD-CT is carried out in radiology centers which comply with the charter of good practice of LD-CT.||The General Practitioners (GPs) and the pneumologists deal with the management of abnormalities which are eventually found by the CT according to the decision algorithms defined by the steering committee which has also validated a standard CT report. If the LD-CT proves to be normal, the screening is negative, the patient is invited again by ADEMA 80 the following year for a new LD-CT.||If the CT is abnormal , depending on the nodule' s size and/or nature either a new LD-CT is carried out after 3 months or if the screening is positive the patient's case is presented during a multidisciplinary team meeting with pneumologists, radiologists, oncologists, thoracic surgeons, pathologists.||Participants of the screening are being made aware of the benefits of quitting smoking and refer to a consultation on tobacco control if necessary.||A copy of the CT results is given to the local cancer screening agency (ADEMA 80) which is in charge with keeping a track and with statistic analyses.||This is a study with 2-year inclusion period. The length of the study is of 3 years.||It is the first study of lung cancer screening by LD-CT which is made at a regional scale in France.||Expected public health impact. The main objective of this screening is to assess the feasibility of an organized individual screening by LD-CT for a heavy smoker population aged from 55 to 74 in the Somme department, department with high incidence of lung cancer.||The secondary goals are to determine incidence of false positives, the number of screened cancers and staging, the histological subtypes, the sensibility and the specificity of this screening, to assess the treatments which have been implemented and the time it takes to deliver appropriate, to rate the quality of life and assess the incentive means to quit smoking",Not Applicable,Experimental,Other: Low dose CT scan,low dose CT scan,Unknown status,Interventional,"February 26, 2019"

Stagement is closely related to the 5 years of survival rate of patients. The postoperative 5-year survival rate is above 90% for stage ⅠA lung cancer patients, while the 5-year survival rate of stage IV lung cancer patients is less than 5%. Therefore, early screening and diagnosis for lung cancer is a key method to reduce lung cancer mortality and prolong survival for patients.||At present, low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is the most effective method for early detection of lung cancer. In addition to imaging examination, plasma tumor markers detection is also a common clinical detection method for tumor screening and postoperative monitoring.||Liquid biopsy is a non-invasive or minimally invasive method for testing blood or other liquid samples to analyze tumor-related markers including nucleic acids and proteins. Several studies have explored the detection of hot spot gene mutations, methylation and methylation changes of DNA, protein markers and autoantibodies in peripheral blood in lung cancer patients. Liquid biopsy has generally become the most popular field for early diagnosis of lung cancer.||Based above, it is necessary to combine multi-omics methods to improve the detection of early stage lung cancer.

cancer,Inclusion Criteria:||Subjects at high risk of lung cancer: current smokers smoking 30 pack-years or more or ex-smokers smoking 30 pack-years or more and who have quit smoking for less than 15 years and currently or previously occupationally exposed to lung carcinogens. With an algorithm for determination of minimal duration of exposure to occupational carcinogens (according to the type and duration of occupational lung carcinogens)||Exclusion Criteria:||Presence of clinical signs of lung cancer|Subjects with a history of lung cancer|Presence of serious short-term life-threatening comorbidities|Absence of occupational exposure to lung carcinogens according to the predefined criteria|Subjects already included in another prospective cohort study|Subjects already assessed by chest CT scan during the previous year|No tobacco exposure or insufficient tobacco exposure or smoking cessation for more than 15 years.,"The good clinical practice guidelines for the surveillance of workers after occupational exposure to lung carcinogens were approved by the Haute Autorité de la Santé (French National Authority for Health) and the Institut National du Cancer (French National Cancer Institute) in December 2015 and the Recommendation R12 of these guidelines concerns the setting-up of a trial of low-dose chest computed tomography (CT) lung cancer screening in subjects occupationally exposed to lung carcinogens at high-risk of lung cancer (Expert consensus).||In LUCSO study, the investigators propose to conduct, under strictly defined conditions, a feasibility study of lung cancer screening in a population defined as being at high risk of lung cancer according to these good clinical practice guidelines. This population consists of smokers, aged from 55 to 74 years, currently or previously exposed to International Agency for Research on Cancer lung group 1 lung carcinogens.||The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the organization of lung cancer screening in the target population. This evaluation will focus on the following indicators:||Screening activity indicator: screening coverage rate over two years|Test quality indicator: validity of self-administered questionnaires to target the high-risk population|Examination quality indicator: lung cancer detection rate, lung cancer detection rates by stage, validity of low-dose chest CT scan|Follow-up indicator: smoking cessation rate, mortality rate||The secondary objectives of the study are:||Describe the population recruited in each step of the protocol|Develop a tool to identify subjects exposed to pulmonary carcinogens and with high-risk of lung cancer|Evaluate the impact of the proposed screening programme on smoking cessation at one, two and three years.|Evaluate the social impact of the screening campaign|Conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of the programme||The proposed study will take place in multidisciplinary and specialized reference centers (SRC) in various French districts participating in the programme, to welcome patients participating. It is organized into six workpackages (WP):||WP1: Methodology - Epidemiology|WP2: Evaluation of occupational exposure|WP3: Imaging|WP4: Lung cancer follow-up strategy|WP5: Smoking cessation|WP6: Medico-economic analysis Six specialized reference centers are proposed in four different regions in order to test a potential region effect and to allow the recruitment by each SRC of about 200 to 600 new eligible subjects per year and per department according to the population and the age pyramid of each department|SRC1: Centre Intercommunal de Créteil for the Val-de-Marne (94), Seine-et-Marne (77), and Essonne (91) departments|SRC2: Bordeaux University Hospital for the Gironde (33) department|SRC3: Rennes University Hospital for the Ille-et-Vilaine (35) department|SRC4: Brest University Hospital for the Finistère (29) department|SRC5: Caen University Hospital for the Calvados (14) department|SRC6: Rouen University Hospital for the Seine-Maritime (76) department||Each of these centers is voluntary and possesses the four essential prerequisites: an occupational health clinic - radiology team with specific skills in chest imaging - pulmonology team or network of pulmonologists specialized in lung cancer - smoking cessation team.||In view of the complexity of this organization, it is proposed to initially test the feasibility and acceptability of the screening programme sequentially for the first two years (24 months) in two SRCs (SRC1 and SRC2): ""Phase 1: 2021-2023"". It is expected to extend the study to the other SRCs after two years: ""Phase 2: 2023-2029"". Ad hoc adjustments will be decided for the creation of SRCs in the third year on the basis of the data acquired in the two pilot departments, especially on the expected target population participation rate. Mortality will be monitored at least until 2031.||The trial will be conducted in several steps:||Identification of subjects currently or previously occupationally exposed to lung carcinogens by a screening invitation letter sent by Departmental Cancer Screening Centers to subjects aged from 55 to 74 years.|Evaluation of occupational exposure to lung carcinogens|Evaluation of the lung cancer risk level and verification of eligibility|Screening procedure: Chest CT scans will be performed by centers specialized in chest imaging|Lung cancer follow-up when an abnormality suggestive of lung cancer is demonstrated.",,,,,Not yet recruiting,Observational,"June 4, 2021"
